# Azure Databricks Utilities

Currently, this repository holds a few utilities for working with Azure Databricks clusters.

## Resources

Generally resources in this repository are jupyter notebooks that can be imported to a databricks cluster workspace.

- `rstudio-init-notebook.ipynb`: a notebook that generates an init script to install rstudio and potentially R packages of your choice
- `check-init-logs.ipynb`: a notebook that allows you to view logs from init processes.
